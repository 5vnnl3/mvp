This is a solo project I completed from scratch as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). 

To set up the environment, use the following commands in your terminal:
-bower install
-npm install
-gulp
-mongod
-nodemon ./server/server.js (seperate tab/window)

In your browser: http://127.0.0.1:4568/
